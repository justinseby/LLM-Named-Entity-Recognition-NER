# MultiNERD Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

## Overview

This project focuses on training and evaluating a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for English using the MultiNERD dataset. The goal is to develop two systems (System A and System B) by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on the English subset of the dataset, filtering out non-English examples, and predicting five entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DISEASES, ANIMAL) along with the 'O' tag.

## Notebooks Explanation

### 1. EDA.ipynb

- **Objective:**
  - Explore the MultiNERD dataset and gain insights into its structure and characteristics.
  - Understand the distribution of entity types and relevant patterns.

### 2. System_A.ipynb

- **Objective:**
  - Fine-tune a pre-trained language model on the English subset of the training set (System A).
  - Evaluate the model's performance on relevant metrics.

### 3. System_B.ipynb

- **Objective:**
  - Modify the dataset to predict five entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DISEASES, ANIMAL) and the 'O' tag.
  - Fine-tune the model on the filtered dataset (System B).
  - Evaluate the performance of System B.


### Instructions to Run the Notebooks



### Evaluation Metrics

- Report and discuss the performance of System A and System B using the chosen evaluation metric(s).
