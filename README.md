## Overview 

This project focuses on training and evaluating a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for English using the MultiNERD dataset. The goal is to develop two systems (System A and System B) by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on the English subset of the dataset, filtering out non-English examples, and predicting five entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DISEASES, ANIMAL) along with the 'O' tag.
